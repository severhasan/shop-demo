# Shoppy

I developed a demo shopping website for a position I thought of applying to. The website has been prepared with NodeJS, NextJS and ReactJS.

### Possible improvements to come in the future:
- Design a better (mobile) layout
- Ask user for address when ordering
- Display loading animations upon creating an order, login or register
- Users should be able to order without logging in.


### Notes
I had no prior knowledge on NextJS. The app took 2 days to finish. I will have to work more on this later on.
